To use tlm_adjoint with the FEniCS backend add the 'python' subdirectory to the
Python search path.

tlm_adjoint is currently targetting FEniCS 2019.1.0, and the Firedrake Git
master branch.

Together with the backend libraries, tlm_adjoint requires

  NumPy
  mpi4py and petsc4py, for the FEniCS or Firedrake backends

tlm_adjoint optionally requires

  PyPNG, for generation of block Jacobian dependency structure images
  SciPy, for gradient-based optimisation and (for the FEniCS backend)
    interpolation equations
  h5py (compiled with MPI enabled for parallel calculations), for checkpointing
    using HDF5
  slec4py, for eigendecomposition functionality
