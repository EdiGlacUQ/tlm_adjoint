To use tlm_adjoint add the 'python' subdirectory to the Python search path. The
library is used via, e.g., the Python code

    FEniCS backend:

        from fenics import *
        from tlm_adjoint.fenics import *

    Firedrake backend:

        from firedrake import *
        from tlm_adjoint_firedrake import *

    NumPy backend:

        import numpy as np
        from tlm_adjoint.numpy import *

tlm_adjoint is currently targeting FEniCS 2019.1.0, and the Firedrake Git
master branch.

Together with the backend libraries, tlm_adjoint requires

    NumPy
    mpi4py
    petsc4py (FEniCS or Firedrake backends)

tlm_adjoint optionally requires

    PyPNG, for generation of block Jacobian dependency structure images
    SciPy, for gradient-based optimization and interpolation equations
    h5py, with the 'mpio' driver for parallel calculations, for HDF5 storage
    petsc4py and slepc4py, for eigendecomposition functionality
